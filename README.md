######  Following are the few concepts (for demonstration purpose, also the considered datasets) from my original projects.
######  1. EKG anomaly detection (time-series data; autoencoder algorithm)
######  2. Semiconductor Manufacturing Product Quality - using deep autoencoder (for dimentionality reduction) and SVM 
######  3. Image recognition by Transfer Learning
######  4. Image classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
######  5. Image segmentation using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
######  6. Object detection extended over image recognition using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
######  7. A self-driving car 
######  8. Sensor signal Processing
######  9. Document summarization
