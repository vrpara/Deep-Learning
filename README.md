######  Following are the few concepts (not the actual datasets due to data confidentiality) from my professional experience.
######  1. EKG anomaly detection (time-series data; autoencoder algorithm)
######  2. Semiconductor Manufacturing Product Quality - using deep autoencoder (for dimentionality reduction) and SVM 
######  3. Image recognition/classification by Transfer Learning
######  4. Video segmentation 
######  5. Supervised Learning Techniques
######  6. Image reconstruction using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
######  7. Biometric authentication using RNN
######  8. Sensor signal Processing (FCN + RNN)
######  9. Document summarization
