######  Following are the few concepts (for demonstration purpose) from my original projects."IBM Cloud Pak for Data" is the working environment
######  1. EKG anomaly detection (unsupervised; time-series)
######  2. Semiconductor Manufacturing Product Quality - using deep autoencoder (for dimentionality reduction) and SVM 
######  3. Unsupervised image classification 
######  4. Image classification using CNN 
######  5. Image segmentation 
######  6. Object detection extended over image recognition 
######  7. A self-driving car 
######  8. Sensor signal Processing
######  9. Document summarization
