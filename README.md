######  Following are the few concepts (for demonstration purpose) from my original projects:
######  1. EKG Anomaly detection Autoencoder (unsupervised)
######  2. Classification Model using deep autoencoder and SVM 
######  3. Unsupervised image classification 
######  4. Image classification using CNN 
######  5. Object detection extended over image recognition
######  6. A self-driving car
######  7. Sensor Signal Processing
