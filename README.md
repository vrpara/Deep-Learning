######  Following are the few concepts (not the actual datasets due to data confidentiality) from my professional experience.
######  1. EKG anomaly detection (time-series data; autoencoder algorithm)
######  2. Semiconductor manufacturing product quality - using deep autoencoder (for dimentionality reduction) and SVM 
######  3. Image recognition/classification by transfer learning
######  4. Video segmentation 
######  5. Supervised learning techniques
######  6. Probability Theory for a robot catching object machine learning application
######  7. Image reconstruction using GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
######  8. Biometric authentication using RNN
######  9. Sensor signal processing (FCN + RNN)
######  10. Document summarization
