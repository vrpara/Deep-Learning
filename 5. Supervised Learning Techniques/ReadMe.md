The data set is experimental measurement data. Two properties were collected, and the features were different adjustable processing parameters. Properties are the responses, while the features are the controllable parameters. 

Aim: To predict the property measurement values for the first ten rows of the data.

From a design perspective, we want to identify which (if any) of the systems corresponding with the first ten rows have the following characteristic: relatively large value for Property1 and ‘Yes’ for Property2. Justify your selection. 

Developed regression and classification models using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Bagging, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and Support Vector Regression. Compared these models in terms of accuracy and robustness, and when applicable in the lens of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
